# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis challenge ensured we could demonstrate the utilize SQL to perform the following:

      a) Create new tables with the INTO statement
  
      b) Export a table as a CSV file
  
      c) Filter queries with the WHERE clause
  
      d) Use the INNER JOIN clause to join two tables on a primary key
  
      e) Use the ON () clause
  
      f) Use an alias instead of a full table name
  
      g) Use the ORDER BY clause
  
      h) Use the COUNT() function to retrieve the total number of rows that matches a specified criteria


## Results: 
The use of those functions enabled some powerful custom analysis across multiple data tables to produce intelligence to Bobby about how to best plan to address their silver tsunami situation. In particular, Booby needed to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)
## Summary:

-The data tables used covered a long period of time that required omitting data from time frames that were not relevant to the need, in particular employees who were too young to retire or who no longer worked at PH or didn't meet the criteria of the succession planning that Bobby wanted to implement. Usage of some key functions helped in this circumstance.

-The multi-step process of counting the number of staff members at the various title levels required several joins and aggregations before the big picture could be quantified to understand which titles would be most impacted.

-The fact that people at PH worked there for a while meant that a special exclusion of their older titles was one of the most complex queries executed in this exercise.

-Engineers across all levels and staff members will be the most in demand titles to fill.

-I would look into each title and assess how long the average retiring person was in their previous title before they attained their current title. This would help Bobby understand the minimum required tenure that a possible successor would need in order to be considered to replace the incumbent retiree.

-I would then look at the non-retiring employees to identify which of them meet those minimum tenure requirements in their current role.

-It might be help to look into the number of retirees hitting age 65 or 67 per title per month in order to prioritize succession planning accordingly.

-A review of the average salaries of exiting employees per title might help define what kind of budget is available to offer new hire employees or to understand how much of a raise PH could offer to an employee who is getting promoted.
