# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis challenge ensured we could demonstrate the utilize SQL to perform the following:

      a) Create new tables with the INTO statement
  
      b) Export a table as a CSV file
  
      c) Filter queries with the WHERE clause
  
      d) Use the INNER JOIN clause to join two tables on a primary key
  
      e) Use the ON () clause
  
      f) Use an alias instead of a full table name
  
      g) Use the ORDER BY clause
  
      h) Use the COUNT() function to retrieve the total number of rows that matches a specified criteria


## Results: 
The use of those functions enabled some powerful custom analysis across multiple data tables to produce intelligence to Bobby about how to best plan to address their silver tsunami situation. In particular, Booby needed to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)
## Summary:
      -The data base used covered a long period of time that required omitting data from time frames that were not relevant to the need, in particular            employees who were too young to retire or didn't meet the criteria of the succession planning that Bobby wanted to implement. Usage of some            key functions helped in this circumstance.
      -The multi-step process of counting the number of staff members at the various title levels required several joins and aggregations before the        big picture
The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
